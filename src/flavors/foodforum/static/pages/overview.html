  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the EcoCity Food Map Melbourne - where you can contribute and explore connections to local markets and food producers. At the City of Melbourne, we're working with communities, organisations and individuals in and around Melbourne to build a better food system - one that is sustainable, resilient and fair.</p>

  <p>A thriving local food sector not only provides us with a wider choice of fresh seasonal produce and more opportunities to buy it, but also greater employment opportunities that help to reinforce Melbourne's reputation as a world class 'city of food'. Community gardens, farmer's markets and small farms in and around the city can contribute significantly to the development of strong local food economy.</p>

  <p>We've partnered with CrowdSpot to help you connect with your local food producers and markets to find healthy, tasty and sustainable food that's available near you, and to help build a better food future for the world's most liveable city.</p>
