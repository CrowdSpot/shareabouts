<h1><strong>Hello!</strong><h1> 
  <h5><p>Welcome to Cycle Stories: your tales of the best and worst across Melbourne's bicycle network.</p> 
  <p>Only a small fraction of incidents involving people on bikes get reported. This is your opportunity to identify the spots where you've had a crash. You can also identify Safe Riding Spots - places you feel particularly safe when riding.</p>
</div>
  <p>The results from this project will be used to help create a more bicycle friendly city.
  <p>Thanks for sharing your story.</p></h5>
