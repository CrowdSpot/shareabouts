<h1><strong>Hello!</strong><h1> 
  <h5><p>Welcome to The Age CrowdSpot Project.</p> 
  <p>Only a small fraction of incidents involving people on bikes get reported. This is your opportunity to identify the spots where you've had a crash.  
  <p>But rather than just identifying where you've encountered trouble on your bike you can also add Safe Riding Spots.</p>
  <p>By sharing your Crash and Safe Spots, you'll help identify the parts of Melbourne with safe and not so safe riding environments.</p>
</div>
  <p>The results from this project will be used to help create a more bicycle friendly city.
  <p>Thanks for telling us your story.</p></h5>
