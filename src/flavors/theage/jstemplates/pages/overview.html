<h1><strong>Hello!</strong><h1> 
  <h5><p>Welcome to Cycle Stories: your tales of the best and worst across Melbourne's bicycle network.</p> 
  <p>Only a small fraction of incidents involving people on bikes get reported. This is your opportunity to identify the spots where you've had a crash. You can also identify Safe Riding Spots - places you feel particularly safe when riding.</p>
</div>
  <p>The results from this project will be used to help create a more bicycle friendly city.</p> 
  <p>You can stay up to date with the project by joining our <a target="_new" href="http://eepurl.com/tkIGb"><span class="s1"><strong>email list</strong></span></a> or connecting on <a target="_new" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Crowd_Spot/314531231976999?ref=hl"><span class="s1"><strong>Facebook</strong></span></a> and <a target="_new" href="https://twitter.com/Crowd_Spot"><span class="s1"><strong>Twitter</strong>.</span></a></p>
