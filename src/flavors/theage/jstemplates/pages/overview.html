<h1><strong>Hello!</strong><h1> 
  <h5><p>Welcome to Cycle Stories: your tales of the best and worst across Melbourne's bicycle network.</p> 
  <p>Only a small fraction of incidents involving people on bikes get reported. Cycle Stories was open from the 22nd of May until the 1st of June and provided the opportunity for people to identify their Crash Spots and Safe Riding Spots.</p>
</div>
  <p>The results from this project will be used to help create a more bicycle friendly city.</p> 
  <p>You can still view all the stories and stay up to date with the project by joining our <a target="_new" href="http://eepurl.com/tkIGb"><span class="s1"><strong>email list</strong></span></a> or connecting on <a target="_new" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Crowd_Spot/314531231976999?ref=hl"><span class="s1"><strong>Facebook</strong></span></a> and <a target="_new" href="https://twitter.com/Crowd_Spot"><span class="s1"><strong>Twitter</strong>.</span></a></p>
