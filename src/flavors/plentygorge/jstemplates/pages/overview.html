<strong><h4><p>Welcome!</p></strong>  
<p><strong>Parks Victoria needs your help to develop a new master plan for Plenty Gorge Park.</strong></p> 
<p><img src="/static/css/images/landscape.jpg"/></p>
<p>A new master plan is being developed to set a vision for Plenty Gorge Park for the next 10 years. The plan will set out how the park will be used, as well as the improvements needed to support recreation activities while protecting and conserving the natural values of the park.</p> 
<p>The current master plan was created 20 years ago, however the surrounding area has gone through huge changes since then, creating new demands and pressures on the park. These changes impact on how the park needs to be developed and managed, and how it connects with the local community.</p>
<p>A new plan is needed so that Plenty Gorge Park can be at the heart of this changing area.</p>
<p><strong>Drop a spot on the map using the crosshair and tell us:</strong></p>
<p><li>What do you like / dislike about Plenty Gorge Park?</li></p>
<p><li>What activities you do in the park?</li></p>
<p><li>What’s your great idea for the future of the park?</li></p>
<p><i>To add a spot, click on the green button marked “Add a Spot”. Then move the background map to align the crosshair (+) to the place you wish to select and then add a comment to tell us about this spot. If there are many spots just zoom in on the map to view them more clearly.</i></p>
