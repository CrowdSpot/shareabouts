<strong><h4><p>Welcome!</p></strong>  
<p><strong>Parks Victoria needs your help to develop a new master plan for Plenty Gorge Park.</strong></p> 
<p>A new master plan is being developed to set a vision for Plenty Gorge Park for the next 10 years. The plan will set out how the park will be used, as well as the improvements needed to support recreation activities and park conservation in the future.</p> 
<p>The current master plan was created 20 years ago, however the surrounding area has gone through huge changes since then, creating new demands and pressures on the park. These changes impact on how the park needs to be developed and managed, and how it connects with the local community.</p>
<p>A new plan is needed so that Plenty Gorge Park can be at the heart of this changing area.</p>
