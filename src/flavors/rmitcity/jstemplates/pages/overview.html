<strong><h4><p>Welcome!</p></strong>  
<p>RMIT is committed to transforming itself into an organisation that models institution-wide excellence in response to national and international calls for tertiary education to play an influential role in helping shape a sustainable future. RMIT acknowledges that its identity and location, as well as its teaching and learning and research activities afford a particular sphere of influence that predisposes RMIT as a significant force to advance the sustainability agenda.</p> 
<p>RMIT are developing an Integrated Sustainable Transport Strategy to support staff and students to make sustainable travel choices for commuting and business travel. The strategy will also support the continued growth of the university across it three Melbourne-based campuses.</p>
<p>In the development of the strategy we are engaging with staff and students to understand the key barriers to using sustainable travel options (i.e. walking, cycling and public transport).</p>
<p>This CrowdSpot website enables staff and students to spatially map barriers they experience or know of in the catchments of our campuses in the City, Brunswick and Bundoora.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about the project please emailÂ hello@mutfung.com.</p>
