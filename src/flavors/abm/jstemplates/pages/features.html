<h1><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h1>
<h5><strong>1. How long is the map open for?</strong></p>
<p>The map is now open indefinitely. We will be providing updates on any changes. We will assess the new information about  once per week or as required.</p>
<strong>2. What happens to the information that is collected?</strong></p>
<p>This phase is concerned with the identification of information, not necessarily the collection. Much of the information identified will be collected at a later stage of the project. This is to ensure information is current when needed and also to confirm with the information owner that conditions of use havenâ€™t changed at the time the information is required. All the information collated here will be kept in a single database at the ABM.</p>
<p><strong>3. What if I make a mistake or want to change some details?</strong></p>
<p>Email Anthony (anthony@crowdspot.com.au) and he'll help sort it out.</p>
<p><strong>4. Still more information needed?</strong></p>
<p>Further information can be provided by Werner Hennecke (Werner.Hennecke@cardno.com.au) or Bernie Cotter  (bcotter@mav.asn.au) about the information collection phase, the Managing Better Now Prospectus, the proposed coastal processes investigation or about CrowdSpot.</p></h4>
