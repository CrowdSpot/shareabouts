<h1><strong>Hello!</strong><h1> 
  <h5><p>Welcome to Port Phillip Bay Data Collection map: your place to share information with other Poret Phillip Bay Counticls.</p> 
  <p>What the  Project is all about, Why are we using crowd spot? How long is it open, What happens if I don’t contribute, Who is involved?.</p>
</div>
  <p>The kind of information we are seeking describes a strategy, plan, layer, image or report that examines:
	  - A hazard (eg erosion rates, flood levels, air photos showing eroding beaches, sediment transport, etc., including spatial data underpinning those hazards)
	  - Impacts of those hazards (height and location of erosion scarp, photos of road closures, beach (protection) works, emergency management plans, etc., including spatial data addressing those impacts).
	  - Documents of coastal change (eg consultants reports, current and historical air photos, oblique photos (‘happy snaps’), etc.
