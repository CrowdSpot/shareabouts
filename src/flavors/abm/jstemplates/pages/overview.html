<h1><strong>Hello!</strong><h1> 
  <h5><p>Welcome to Port Phillip Bay Information Identification: your place to share information with other Port Phillip Bay Councils.</p> 
  <p>What the  Project is all about, why are we using CrowdSpot? How long is it open? What happens if I don’t contribute? Who is involved?</p>
</div>
  <p>The kind of information we are seeking describes a strategy, plan, GIS layer, image or report that examines:
  <p>- A hazard (eg. erosion rates, flood levels, sediment transport, etc.)</p>  
  <p>- Impacts of those hazards (erosion scarp, road closures, beach protection works, emergency management plans, etc.).</p>  
  <p>- Documents of coastal change (eg. consultants reports, aereal photos, oblique photos, ‘happy snaps’, etc.).</p>
  <p>If you have any doubts about the usefulness of the information you have please still add it to the map, particularly if it is publicly available, as other stakeholders may find value. The Information identification process  is  for the use of the ABM councils and partner agencies. It will not be publicly available</p>
  <p>Thanks for contributing.</p></h5>
