<p><h1><strong>Why CrowdSpot?</strong></h1></p>
<h4><p class="p2">Public consultation is an increasingly important part of the planning process. Traditional public engagement can be time consuming, costly and only appeal to a narrow demographic of the community.</p>
<p>CrowdSpot is a practical and intuitive map-based tool designed to complement the planning process for public space improvements. The platform is also great for research and knowledge sharing projects.</p>
<p>We plan to bring you a series of new maps across different topics and locations. You can stay up to date by joining our <a href="http://www.crowdspot.com.au/contact/"><span class="s1">mailing list</span></a>, 'liking' us on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Crowd_Spot/314531231976999?ref=hl"><span class="s1">Facebook</span></a> and following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/Crowd_Spot"><span class="s1">Twitter</span></a></p></h4>
