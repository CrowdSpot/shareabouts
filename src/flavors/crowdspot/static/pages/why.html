<p class="p2">Public consultation is an increasingly important part of the planning process. Traditional public engagement can be time consuming, costly and only appeal to a narrow demographic of the community.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">CrowdSpot is a practical and intuitive web-based tool designed to complement the planning process for public space improvements. CrowdSpot is also great for research and knowledge sharing projects.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">Let's say a government agency is interested in finding out where people have experienced 'near-misses' whilst riding a bike. CrowdSpot is able to configure an online map that allows the community to intuitively highlight the spots they've experienced a close call. Members of the public can also support someone else's spot. The CrowdSpot team provide a detailed analysis of the data, including visualisations such as 'heat maps', to enhanced road safety outcomes. Our roads are made safer by identifying high risk areas, helping transport agencies take meaningful, cost effective action.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">There are literally hundreds of possible uses for CrowdSpot. The only limit is you're imagination.</p>
