  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hello! You're looking at a demo of CrowdSpot - an interactive map that allows people to contribute input on geographic locations. CrowdSpot is great for knowledge sharing or issue reporting projects. Each project is an independent map  with its own design and URL.</p>
  <p>The easiest way to understand how CrowdSpot works is to play around with it and add some spots.  <strong> Follow these steps: </strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. Add a spot</strong> - Choose your location by <strong>dragging the map under the marker.</strong></p>

  <p></p>
  <p><strong>2. Submit your spot</strong> - Click the <strong> Confirm location </strong> button and fill in the details and press submit. Done!</p> 
  <p><strong>3. Check out other spots</strong> - Click on other spots to add comments, support and share locations over Facebook and Twitter.</p>
  
  <p>Our demo map has been setup to allow you to pin spots on locations where you want WiFi Internet Hotspots - just one of hundreds of possible uses.</p>
