  <p>Hello! You're looking at a demo of CrowdSpot.</p>
  <p>CrowdSpot is a simple web app for crowdsourced mapping. You can use it to collect public input on maps - for example, where should a new park be built? Which bus stops need a new shelter? People can put spots on the map, add comments, vote, discuss other people's suggestions and share locations over social networks.</p>
  <p>Read more about CrowdSpot at <a href="http://www.crowdspot.com.au/"><span class="s1">crowdspot.com.au</span></a>.</p>
  <p>Thanks for trying out CrowdSpot!</p>
