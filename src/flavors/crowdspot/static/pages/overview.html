  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hello! You're looking at a demo of CrowdSpot - an intuitive map-based tool designed to complement the planning process for public space improvements. CrowdSpot is also great for research and knowledge sharing projects.</p>
  <p>The easiest way to understand how CrowdSpot works it to try it out - it only takes a minute. You can put spots on the map, add comments, vote, discuss other people's suggestions and share locations over Facebook and Twitter.</p>
  <p>Our demo has been setup to allow you to pin spots on locations for Bike Share Docks, WiFi Hotspots and Public Toilets - just three of hundreds of possible uses.</p>
