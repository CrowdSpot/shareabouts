  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hello! You're looking at a demo of CrowdSpot - an intuitive map-based tool designed to complement the planning process for public space improvements. CrowdSpot is also great for research and knowledge sharing projects.</p>
  <p>The easiest way to understand how CrowdSpot works it to try it out - it only takes a minute to. <strong> Follow these steps: </strong></p>
  <p>1. To add a spot - Choose your location by <strong>dragging the map under the marker</strong></p> 
  <p>2. To submit your spot - Click the <strong> Add a Spot </strong> button and fill in the details and press submit. Done!</p> 
  <p>3. Check out other spots - Click on other spots to add comments, support and share locations over Facebook and Twitter.</p>
  
  <p>Our demo has been setup to allow you to pin spots on locations where you want WiFi Hotspots, Bike Share Docks and Public Toilets - just three of hundreds of possible uses.</p>
