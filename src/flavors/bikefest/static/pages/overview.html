  <h1>About</h1>
<p>Hello! Welcome to the Bikefest Spot Share project.</p>
<p>Melbourne is a great place to ride with a multitude of bike friendly spots. We've all got our favourite places, providers and events but there has never been a single map that captured this collective experience. We've teamed up with the recently launched CrowdSpot  to map and share the knowledge on our city's most loved bicycle spots.</p>
<p>Make your mark on Melbourne and show your love for riding a bike. We're looking for Sweet Spots, Hot Spots, Beauty Spots and Shop Spots. Go to <strong><a href="http://bikefest-crowdspot.dotcloud.com/page/why" target="_new"><span class="s1">The Spots</span></a></strong> page to find their meaning and then add your spot.</p> 
<p><strong> Follow these steps: </strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. Add a spot</strong> - Choose your location by <strong>dragging the map under the marker. Zoom in by pressing the plus/minus symbols in the top left.</strong></p>
