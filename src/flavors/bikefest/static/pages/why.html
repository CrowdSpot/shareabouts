    <strong>Sweet Spot</strong> - Have you found the perfect post ride three quarter latte? Are the eggs at this spot worth a long ride? Where is your favourite place to dock those tired legs and knock the top off a cold one? Share your favourite rider friendly cafe, bar, restaurant or any spot with good grub or good times for thirsty folk.

    <strong>Shop Spot</strong> - Jeepers creepers where'd you get that? For every person that rides there is a bike riding with them, and sometimes a whole lot more. Where is your favourite spot to stock up on the things you need for your life in the bike lane? It might be a shopfront, it might be a market, it might be some guy's backyard - but if we can get it too - drop a pin on it.
