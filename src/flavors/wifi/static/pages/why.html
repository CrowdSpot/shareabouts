<h1>What is CrowdSpot for?</h1>
<p class="p2">Public consultation is an increasingly important part of the planning process. Traditional public engagement can be time consuming, costly and only appeal to a narrow demographic of the community.</p>
<p>CrowdSpot is a practical and intuitive map-based tool designed to complement the planning process for public space improvements. The platform is also great for research and knowledge sharing projects.</p>
<p>Let's say a government agency is interested in finding out where people have experienced 'near-misses' whilst riding a bike. CrowdSpot is able to configure an online map that allows the community to pin spots on locations they've experienced a close call. The CrowdSpot team can then provide a detailed analysis of the data, including visualisations such as 'heat maps', to identify high risk areas, helping transport agencies take meaningful, cost effective action.</p>
