<strong><h4><p>Welcome!</p></strong>  
<p>This collaboration between Assemble Papers and Crowdspot is a ‘Back to the Future’ map, charting Melbourne’s favourite independent establishments.</p> 
<p>In our fast-paced era of multitasking, urban gentrification, demolition and renewal, many cultural icons become forgotten in the mists of time. Perhaps your favourite grocer or barbershop was set up in a time before the internet replaced the Yellow Pages?</p> 
<p>To celebrate the importance and vibrancy of these establishments, and to help ensure they continue to thrive, this map collects and recognises the classic shops, barbers, grocers, cafes and social spaces that have stood the test of time.</p></h4>
