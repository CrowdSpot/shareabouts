<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>The City of Greater Bendigo needs to find out how goods are moved around Greater Bendigo.</p>

<p>During a two-phased process, we will gather information from both freight users (Phase 1) and freight providers (Phase 2) to identify practical solutions for decision makers in government and business.</p>


<p>This Phase 1 survey is important because it will help us identify:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Current industry characteristics;</li>
  <li>Freight movement volumes and patterns;</li>
  <li>Barriers and opportunities associated with enhancing freight efficiency and sustainability;</li>
 </ul>
</p>

<p>Phase 2 survey will target freight providers only and will be undertaken upon completion of Phase 1.</p>

<p>By taking part in the Bendigo Freight Study survey you are helping us find ways to make the freight network more responsive to your businessâ€™s needs and the needs of our growing city.</p>
