<p><strong>6. What are the routes contained in the legend?</strong></p>

<p>Off-road routes are bicycle paths that are separate to roads. These are often shared with walkers. Some are for bikes only such as along Harbour Esplanade, Docklands.</p>

<p>On-road bike lanes are routes on existing roads with some form of signage and support for riders. These can vary from fully separated lanes such as on LaTrobe Street, to lanes with only line marking. </p>

<p>Informal bike routes are roads commonly used by riders. There is limited formal support for riders but riders may choose the route because it is a low speed or quiet environment.</p>

<p>These routes appear on the TravelSmart map 2014. A full review of mapping will be conducted as part of the bicycle planning process.</p>

<p><strong>7. What does bike parking relate in the legend?</strong></p>

<p>A small bicycle icon (when zoomed-in) denotes where every City of Melbourne bike hoop is located. There are over 2000 bicycle hoops in the municipality.</p>
