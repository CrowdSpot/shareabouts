<h1><strong>Hello!</strong><h1> 
  <h5><p>Welcome to Cycle Stories 2014: your tales of the best and worst across Melbourne's bicycle network.</p> 
  <p>Due to the success of the original <a target="_new" href="http://www.theage.com.au/data-point/CrowdSpotCycleMap"><span class="s1">Cycle Stories project</span></a> with The Age in 2013 we've decided to keep the project running.</p>
  <p>Since only a small fraction of incidents involving people on bikes get reported this map provides a great way for people to share their cycle story.</p>
</div>
  <p>The results from this project will be used to help create a more bicycle friendly city.</p> 
  <p>You can still view all the stories and stay up to date with the project by joining our <a target="_new" href="http://eepurl.com/tkIGb"><span class="s1"><strong>email list</strong></span></a> or connecting on <a target="_new" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Crowd_Spot/314531231976999?ref=hl"><span class="s1"><strong>Facebook</strong></span></a> and <a target="_new" href="https://twitter.com/Crowd_Spot"><span class="s1"><strong>Twitter</strong>.</span></a></p>
  <p>Thanks for sharing your story.</p></h5>
