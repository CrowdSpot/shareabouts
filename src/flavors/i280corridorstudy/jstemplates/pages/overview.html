<h1>How Can We Make I-280 Better?</h1>

<p>VTA is conducting a study of the Santa Clara County’s I-280 Corridor to develop a strategic plan. The study limits would extend approximately 22 miles from the San Mateo/Santa Clara County boarder to the I-280/I-680 interchange in the City of San Jose.  The study is a collaborative effort with local, state and regional stakeholders to identify possible transportation improvement projects along the I-280 corridor that promotes mobility and connectivity, enhance safety and security, support economic vitality and sustainability, and is sensitive to the environment and community values.  </p>

<p>You are invited to share with us what freeway, local roadway, bike and pedestrian, and transit improvements you would like to see along the I-280 corridor by completing our survey.</p>
