<h1><strong>Tips for new spots:</strong></h1>
<h4><p>1. What makes it difficult to cross? Is there enough time? Do you wait too long for the green man? Do people cross on the red man?</p>
<p>2. Do you feel safe crossing at that location? Have you ever witnessed an accident there? Do you find vehicles will turn across your path while you are still crossing rather than give way?</p>
<p>3. Is the waiting area on the side of the road or traffic island sufficient? Does it ever get too crowded at certain times of the day?</p>
