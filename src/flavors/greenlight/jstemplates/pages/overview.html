<h1><p><strong>Port Phillip Greenlight</strong></p></h1> 
<h4><p>To get more people walking, the City of Port Phillip wants to help make it easier to cross at traffic lights, particularly on major roads.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us where you find it hard to cross the street and why.</strong></p>
<p>Your feedback will help us to advocate to VicRoads to make changes to traffic signals.</p>
<p>Give us your feedback by either adding a new crossing location or supporting and commenting on existing spots.</p>
<p><li>Green spots are crossing locations suggested by you.</li></p>
<p><li>Orange spots are existing crossing locations that we want to collect specific feedback on for the purposes of a separate study.</li></p>
<p>You can also share your spot on social media using #portphillipgreenlight.</p> 
<p>If you have any other questions about the project please feel free to us at <u>helpenvrenewal@portphillip.vic.gov.au</u></p>
