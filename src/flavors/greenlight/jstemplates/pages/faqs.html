<h1><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h1>
<strong>Who has responsibility for traffic signals?</strong></p>
<p>All traffic signals are operated by VicRoads. VicRoads aims to coordinate traffic lights to improve traffic flow and safety for road users. Council must advocate to VicRoads to request new signals or to suggest changes to existing signals.</p>
<p><strong>Why does Port Phillip support walking?</strong></p>
<p>We committed to improve pedestrian priority at key signalised crossings within the municipality in the Walk Plan 2011-2020. The main aim of the Walk Plan is to make the City of Port Phillip better for walking and to do this we recognise pedestrians as a priority as they are the most vulnerable road users.</p>
<p><strong>Why are Port Phillip Council doing this consultation exercise?</strong></p>
<p>We know from previous consultation that large roads can often act as a barrier to people walking given the amount of time it takes to cross at certain locations. This is a particular issue for older and younger persons and the mobility impaired who often need more time to cross. This exercise will give us more information on where people find it difficult to cross at traffic signals and why.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to my feedback?</strong></p>
<p>We will analyse all feedback to identify possible crossing improvements and will use this to advocate for changes to VicRoads.</p>
<p><strong>How long is the map open for?</strong></p>
<p>The map will be open until 22 April 2014.</p>
