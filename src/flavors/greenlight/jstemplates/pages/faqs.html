<h1><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h1>
<strong>How does the map work?</strong></p>
<p>To add a 'spot' move the map beneath the central cross-hair. Zooming-in helps to find a more exact location. When you've found your location click the 'add a spot' button and complete the survey. You can also view other people's contributions. Feel free to 'support' or comment on other spots.</p>
<p><strong>How long is the map open for?</strong></p>
<p>We expect the map to be open until the end of April.</p>
<p><strong>Who manages Melbourne's bike share scheme?</strong></p>
<p>Melbourne Bike Share is the responsibility of the State Government who contracts an operator to manage the system. The contract with the current operator, RACV, is scheduled to finish in June 2014. The City of Port Phillip will be providing our ideal locations for stations in anticipation of a system expansion.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to the data that is collected?</strong></p>
<p>The data collected on this map will be analysed, along with other information, to help inform what a priority list of bike share station locations may be.</p>
<p><strong>Why are the City of Port Phillip doing this community engagement activity?</strong></p>
<p>The City of Port Phillip supports Melbourne Bike Share as a convenient way for people to make short trips and as a realistic alternative to driving, as it helps to realise Councilâ€™s vision of better connected and liveable city. As a result, Council has made the decision to be pro-active in involving the community to help decide the locations for priority bike share stations. In the case of a future expansion, this information along with other Council priorities will be given as feedback to VicRoads.</p>
