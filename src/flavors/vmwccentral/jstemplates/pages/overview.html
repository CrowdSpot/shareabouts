<p>What do you think of Victoria's mineral springs?</p> 
<p>As part of a new master plan being developed, we are currently seeking you input on what you think about Victoria's mineral springs.</p>
<p>Please share either the spots you like or the spots where you have ideas for improvement. You can contribute to the map by: 
 <ul>
  <li><strong>'Adding a Spot'</strong> on the map with a description, link and image. You can add either 'like' or 'idea' spots;</li> 
  <li><strong>Voting</strong> on spots by clicking the <strong>'Support'</strong> button within existing spots already on the map;</li>
  <li>Leaving a <strong>comment</strong> within existing spots already on the map;</li>
  <li><strong>Sharing</strong> the map with those who you know have a strong connection to V mineral springs;</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>The most ‘supported’ spots will be recognised during the 2015 National Planning Congress and act as a great resource for everyone.</p>

<p>Thanks and see you at Congress 2015!</p>
