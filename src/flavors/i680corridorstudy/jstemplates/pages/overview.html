<p>What improvements are needed along the I-680 Corridor in Santa Clara County?</p>

<p>VTA and Caltrans are preparing the I-680 Corridor Study to develop a strategic plan for I-680 in Santa Clara County.  The intent of the study is to identify and address traffic congestion, pedestrian and bicycle access and accommodation, transit connectivity and other transportation-related issues along the corridor.</p>
