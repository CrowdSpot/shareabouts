<p>Through a collaborative effort with local, state and regional agencies, VTA is preparing the I-680 Corridor Study to develop a strategic plan for the I-680 corridor in Santa Clara County.  The intent of the study is to identify and address traffic congestion, pedestrian and bicycle access and accommodation, transit connectivity and any other transportation-related issues along the corridor.  All input provided in this interactive survey will be used towards developing the most comprehensive strategic plan.</p>
