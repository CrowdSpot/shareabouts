<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>What do you think about transport in the City of Perth?</p>

<p>We are in the process of developing an Integrated Transport Strategy and need your input.</p>

<p>We want to know: 
 <ul>
  <li>Where are your transport issues</li>
  <li>What transport routes do you like and why</li>
  <li>What are your ideas to help improve movement across the city</li> 
 </ul>
</p>

<p>Try <strong>'Adding a Spot'</strong> to the map! You can also comment on other people's spots or add your vote to a spot by clicking the <strong>'Support' </strong> button.</p>
