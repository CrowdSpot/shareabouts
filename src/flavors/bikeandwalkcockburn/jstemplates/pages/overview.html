<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>How can we improve roads and paths so more people ride bicycles and walk in the City of Cockburn?</p>

<p>The City of Cockburn is working on a new draft Bicycle Plan 2016-2020, which will encourage more people to ride bicycles and walk as a travel choice.</p> 
<p>We want to develop a more connected bicycle network, improving links to existing routes and making cycling more accessible for people of all ages and abilities. The online mapping tool gives you the opportunity to comment on locations where bicycle, pedestrian or shared path infrastructure are required or can be improved.</p>

<p>We want to know: 
 <ul>
  <li>Where you <i>like</i> riding your bicycle or walking in the City of Cockburn.</li>
  <li>Your <i>ideas</i> to improve bike riding and walking in the City.</li>
  <li>Your bike riding and walking <i>issues</i> and challenges in the City.</li> 
 </ul>
</p>

<p>Try <strong>'Adding a Spot'</strong> to the map! You can also comment on other people's spots or add your vote to a spot by clicking the <strong>'Support' </strong> button.</p>
