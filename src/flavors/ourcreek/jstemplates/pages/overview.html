<p>We’re creating a long term plan for XXXXXXXXXX </p>

<p>To help do that, we're interested in the below themes:
 <ul>
  <li>Environment - Tell us about any spots on the creek with special plants or animals</li>
  <li>Transport / access – Tell us about where you travel along/access the creek and your ideas for improvements</li>
  <li>History and stories – Share your stories about the creek and upload photos</li>
  <li>Attractions – Tell us about your favourite places to visit</li>
  <li>Ideas – If you could change one thing, what would it be? What is your vision for the creek in the future?</li>
 </ul>
</p>  

<h5>To add a new Spot simply follow these steps :</h5>  
 <ol type="I">
  <li>Click the big <strong>Add a Spot</strong> button.</li>
