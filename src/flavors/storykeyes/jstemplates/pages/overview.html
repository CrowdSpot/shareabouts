<h1>How can the Story-Keyes Corridor be improved?</h1>

<p>VTA, in partnership with the City of San Jose, is preparing the Story-Keyes Corridor Complete Streets Study, covering Willow Street, Keyes Street and Story Road for over 4 miles from State Route 87 to Capitol Expressway.</p>

<p>The goal of the Study is to make the corridor safer and easier to use for pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit riders, while still serving drivers. VTA and the City are working with residents and other stakeholders to gather input and make recommendations for the corridor.</p>

<p>You are invited to share with us what pedestrian, bicycle, transit and roadway issues and improvements you would like to point out along the corridor by completing this map survey.</p>

<p>The survey will be open for responses until December 9, 2016. If you have comments or questions about the Story-Keyes Corridor Complete Streets Study, please call VTAâ€™s Community Outreach Department at (408) 321-7575, (TTY) for the hearing-impaired (408) 321-2330, or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:community.outreach@vta.org">community.outreach@vta.org</a>. For more information: <a rel="internal" href="/page/why">storykeyessurvey.vta.org</a>.</p>
