<h1>Hey there!</h1>

<p>The streets of Melbourne are our domain. Here, we should feel welcome, valued, safe and included. But do you really feel like you have a say in your own city?</p>

<p>This is your chance.</p>

<p>Where in Melbourne do you feel safe? Where do you feel happy and like you belong? Tell us about it.</p>

<p>What about places you feel unsafe? Ever been curb-crawled on the street? Barged into? Catcalled? Wolf-whistled? Hassled on a tram or train, or while waiting for one? Where do you feel uneasy or unwelcome?</p>

<p>We’ve heard from girls and young women all over the globe who say they don’t feel safe or welcome in public places. That’s half the population who feel like they don’t belong, who are even changing the way they act, what they wear, or the places they go. It’s not OK. It has to change. So let’s change it.</p>

<p>You’re joining girls across the globe shaping their own cities. We’ll be sharing the results here in Melbourne with the City of Melbourne, Victoria Police, Yarra Trams, Public Transport Victoria, bar and club owners, retailers and anyone who has a role to play in making our city a welcoming, safe, fun place to be.</p>

<p>Because all of us should feel <strong>Free To Be in Melbourne</strong>.</p>
