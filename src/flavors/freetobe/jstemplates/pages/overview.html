<p>The streets of Melbourne are our domain. Here, we should feel welcome, valued, safe and included. But do you really feel like you have a say in your own city? This is your chance.</p>

<p>Where in Melbourne do you feel safe, happy and like you belong? What about places you feel unsafe, or where you get harassed or made to feel uneasy? Tell us about it.</p>

<p>Because all of us should feel <strong>Free To Be in Melbourne</strong>.</p>
