<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Thank you for contributing to our Darebin Traffic and Transport Survey. We are inviting you to share your thoughts, concerns and ideas about traffic in your street and neighbourhood, and transport across Darebin.</p>

<p>Everyone in Darebin have been invited to have their say and information we collect as part of this survey process will help shape our upcoming Traffic Management Strategy work, and how we advocate to the State and Federal government and authorities for better transport outcomes for Darebin. We will be reporting back on these outcomes to the community in August.</p>

<p>We also invite you to attend one of our public forums which will be taking place throughout Darebin in June. Bring your questions along for your Councillors and Darebin staff. The dates, times and locations can be found at <a href="http://www.darebin.vic.gov.au/yoursay"target="new">www.darebin.vic.gov.au/yoursay</a></p>

<p>To thank you for taking part in our survey, we would like to give you the opportunity to win a $300 Darebin gift pack including passes to our leisure and recreation centres, and movie and shopping vouchers.</p>
