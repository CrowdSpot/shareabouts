<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Thank you for participating in our Darebin Traffic and Transport Survey. We are inviting you to share your thoughts, concerns and ideas about traffic in your street and neighbourhood, and transport across Darebin.</p>

<p>Everyone in Darebin have been invited to have their say and information we collect as part of this survey process will help shape our upcoming Traffic Management Strategy work, and how we advocate to the State and Federal government and authorities for better transport outcomes for Darebin. We also invite you to attend one of our <a href="http://www.darebin.vic.gov.au/yoursay"target="new">public forums</a> which will be taking place throughout Darebin in June.</p>
