<strong>Thank you to those who took part in the Darebin Traffic and Transport Consultation. Darebin Council will be reporting back to the community on the key findings in August.</strong>

<h1>Welcome to the Darebin Traffic and Transport Location Plotter</h1>

<p>The purpose of this Location Plotter is to enable you to share your thoughts on traffic and transport matters at specific locations.</p>

<p>Your input will help shape the upcoming Darebin Traffic Management Strategy, the works that follow, and how we advocate on priority transport projects. You are also invited to one of our <a href="http://darebintrafficsurvey.crowdspot.com.au/page/moreinfo">public forums</a> taking place in June around Darebin.</p>

<h5>There are 2 different ways that you can contribute to this survey:</h5>
