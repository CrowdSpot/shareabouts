<h1>About</h1>

<p>What great places do you want to recognise and promote across Melbourne and Victoria?</p>
<p>Please share your favourites on the ‘Planning Congress CrowdSpot map’.  Places could be recently delivered projects, Melbourne ‘institutions’, or a policy, program or initiative that collectively contribute to making cities great. You can contribute to the map by: 
 <ul>
  <li><strong>'Adding a Spot'</strong> on the map with a description, link and image;</li> 
  <li>Commenting and voting on places by clicking the <strong>'Support'</strong> button within existing spots already on the map;</li>
  <li>Parking a question in the bay if you are not from Melbourne and want some local knowledge.</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>The most ‘supported’ places will be recognised during the 2015 National Planning Congress and act as a great resource for everyone.</p>

<p>Thanks and see you at Congress 2015!</p>
