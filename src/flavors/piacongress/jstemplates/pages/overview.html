<h1>About</h1>

<p>What great places do you want to recognise and promote across Melbourne and Victoria?</p>
<p>Please share your favourite places on the ‘Planning Congress CrowdSpot map’.  Places could be recently delivered projects or places that you feel are ‘institutions’ and should be recognised. You can contribute to the map by: 
 <ul>
  <li><strong>'Adding a Place'</strong> on the map with a description, link and image;</li> 
  <li>Commenting and voting on places by clicking the <strong>'Support'</strong> button within existing spots already on the map;</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>The most ‘supported’ places will be recognised during the Planning Congress. Your contributions will also help PIA shape the Congress program, plan for possible events during the Congress and also act as great resource for everyone.</p>

<p> Thanks and see you at Congress 2015! </p>
