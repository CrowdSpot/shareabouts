<p>What great places in Melbourne do we need to know about?</p>

<p> Please share your local knowledge about where PIA could hold events; arrange walking and site tours or what you want to find out more about when you are at Congress in Melbourne in May 2015. We want to share all those things that only a local would know so that we can shape a great program and create a resource for everyone planning to come to Congress in 2015. You can do so by either: 
 <ul>
  <li><strong>'Adding a Place'</strong> on the map with an image, description and link;</li> 
  <li>Voting on places by clicking the <strong>'Support'</strong> button within existing spots already on the map;</li>
  <li>Leaving a <strong>comment</strong> within an existing place; or</li>
  <li><strong>Sharing</strong> the map with colleagues, family and friends</li>
 </ul>
</p>
  
<p> At this stage the map will be open right up until the event on 13-15 May but we will be looking at it all regularly and positing confirmed locations and program details as we lock them in.</p>

<p> Thanks and see you at Congress 2015! </p>
