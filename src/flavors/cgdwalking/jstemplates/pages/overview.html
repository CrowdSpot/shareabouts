<h1>About</h1>

<p>Walking has lots of benefits and the City of Greater Dandenong wants to make it easier and more enjoyable for the community.</p>

<p>In order to do this, we want to know: 
 <ul>
  <li>where your favourite local walking spots are</li>
  <li>how you think we can improve particular walking spots</li>
  <li>what motivates you to walk (or not!)</li> 
  <li>if there is anything that discourages you from walking</li>
  <li>how we can encourage more people to get out and enjoy walking</li>
 </ul>
</p>

<p>Try <strong>'Adding a Spot'</strong> to the map! You can also comment on other people's spots or add your vote to a spot by clicking the <strong>'Support' </strong> button.

<p>Your contribution will help inform Greater Dandenong's Walking Strategy, which aims to increase the number of people walking in Greater Dandenong by activating places, spaces and people through increased access and opportunity to walk.</p>
