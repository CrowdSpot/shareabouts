<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>We’re creating a long term plan for Bendigo’s public spaces – our parks, gardens, sports fields, regional parks, creek corridors, key streets, etc.</p>

<p>To help do that, we need your input. We are interested to know:
 <ul>
  <li>What spaces and places are in your neighbourhood (and around the municipality) and how you would rate them?</li>
  <li>Your ideas for improving existing spaces or creating new ones?</li>
  <li>How safe you feel in the space you use?</li>
 </ul>
</p>  

<p>Add as many Spots to the Greater Bendigo map as you like. You can also <strong>comment</strong> on other people’s spots or give the thumbs up by clicking the <strong>'Support'</strong> button.</p>
