  <p>What's your favourite EcoCity Spot in Melbourne?</p>
  <p>Melbourne is full of sustainable projects, events, shops and organisations but we've never had a place to capture them until now. The interactive 'My EcoCity Map' was created as a way for the city and its many residents and visitors to share knowledge about all the amazing projects taking place that contribute in reducing our city's footprint.</p>
  
    <p>The map is simple - it only takes a minute to contribute. <strong> Follow these steps: </strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. Add a spot</strong> - Choose your location by <strong>dragging the map under the marker.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>2. Submit your spot</strong> - Click the <strong> Add a Spot </strong> button and fill in the details and press submit. Done!</p> 
  <p><strong>3. Check out other spots</strong> - Click on other spots to add comments, support and share locations over Facebook and Twitter.</p>
