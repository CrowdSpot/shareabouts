  <p>What's your favourite EcoCity Spot in Melbourne?</p>
  <p>Melbourne is full of sustainable projects, events, shops and organisations but we've never had a place to capture them until now. The interactive 'My EcoCity Map' was created as a way for the city and its many residents and visitors to share knowledge about all the amazing projects taking place that contribute in reducing our footprint.</p>
  <p>The map is simple. Drag the map under the marker and press the button to submit your location. Complete and submit the short form and you've contributed! You can also click on other spots to show your support, leave a comment and share through twitter and Facebook.</p>
  <p>Check out 'The Spots' page above to see the different categories of spots or simply close this window in the top left corner to get started!.</p>
