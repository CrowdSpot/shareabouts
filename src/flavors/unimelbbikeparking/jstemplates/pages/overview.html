<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p> Where do you want more bike parking? </p>

<p> Please share your thoughts on where we need more bike parking at the Parkville Campus. You can do so by either: 
 <ul>
  <li><strong>'Adding a Spot'</strong> on the map;</li> 
  <li>Voting on spots by clicking the <strong>'Support'</strong> button within existing spots already on the map;</li>
  <li>Leaving a <strong>comment</strong> within an existing spot; or</li>
  <li><strong>Sharing</strong> the map with University friends you know who ride to Uni (Parkville Campus)</li>
 </ul>
</p>
  
<p> At this stage map will be open for contribution until the 5th of November where the results will then be analysed to help inform the university where to plan for future bike parking at the Parkville Campus.</p>

<p> Thanks for your help! </p>
