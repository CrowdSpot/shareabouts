<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Nominate a project where communities are experiencing change and are being engaged in the process</p>

<p>As practitioners we are constantly briefed about projects or new tools within our sector, but rarely get out to see how communities are experiencing change and how they are being engaged in the process.</p>

<p>Engage2Act want to address this gap by providing an ‘out of the office’ experience where practitioners working on projects across the city have the opportunity to profile them to their peers, in situ. </p>

<p>This ‘out of office’ experience involves a four hour bus tour to visit four or five projects around the city that have been nominated and voted on by you – our Engage2Act colleagues. You can also nominate to discuss a policy or strategy, informed by community feedback, which is now influencing change across the city.</p>

<p>No PowerPoint, no paper, no office; just a microphone, 15 minutes of fame, lollies, bus games and a bus full of networking peers. 
To make sure the event meets your needs, we will be seeking your feedback to design it, using a Crowdspot map and a ranking process. Then, when the event details have been finalised, we will ask you to book your place on the bus, using the E2A Facebook page.</p>

<p>Nominate a project on the map by either: 
 <ul>
  <li>Adding a spots on the map!</li>
  <li>Voting on the projects you like to visit by clicking the 'support' button</li>
  <li>You can also comment on project spots</li> 
 </ul>
</p>
