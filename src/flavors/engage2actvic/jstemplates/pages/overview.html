<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Help us plan the next Engage2Act event!</p> 

<p>Rather than choosing a standard event format we want to get out to see how communities are experiencing change and how they are being engaged in the process.</p>

<p>This event is an ‘out of the office’ bus tour experience where practitioners working on projects across the city have the opportunity to profile them to their peers. No PowerPoint, no paper, no office; just a microphone, 15 minutes of fame, games and a bus full of networking peers.</p>

<p>We're now seeking your feedback to design the event. Nominate a project on the map by either: 
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Adding a spot</strong> on the map!</li>
  <li>Voting on the projects you like to visit by clicking the <strong>'support'</strong> button</li>
  <li><strong>Commenting</strong> on project spots</li> 
 </ul>
</p>

<p>Then, when the event details have been finalised, we will ask you to book your place on the bus!</p>
