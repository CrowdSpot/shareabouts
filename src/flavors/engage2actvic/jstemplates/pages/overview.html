<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Help us plan the next Engage2Act event!</p> 

<p>Rather than choosing a standard event format we want to get out to see how communities are experiencing change and how they are being engaged in the process</p>

<p>This event is an ‘out of the office’ bus tour experience where practitioners working on projects across the city have the opportunity to profile them to their peers. No PowerPoint, no paper, no office; just a microphone, 15 minutes of fame, games and a bus full of networking peers.</p>

<p>We're now seeking your feedback to design the event. The crowdsourced information collected will help us plan the four hour bus tour to visit up to five projects around the city that have been nominated and voted on by you! – our Engage2Act colleagues. You can also nominate to discuss a policy or strategy, informed by community feedback, which is now influencing change across the city.</p>

<p>Nominate a project on the map by either: 
 <ul>
  <li>Adding a spot on the map!</li>
  <li>Voting on the projects you like to visit by clicking the 'support' button</li>
  <li>You can also comment on project spots</li> 
 </ul>
</p>

<p>To <strong>nominate</strong> a project simply: 
 <ol>
  <li>Click the big blue <strong>'Add a Spot'</strong> button, choose your location and complete the form</li>
  <li>Vote on the projects you'd like to hear about by clicking the <strong>'support'</strong> button</li>
 </ol>

<p>Then, when the event details have been finalised, we will ask you to book your place on the bus!</p>
