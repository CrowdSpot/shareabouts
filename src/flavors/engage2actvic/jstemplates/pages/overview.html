<h3>Welcome to the Community Engagement and Urban Change: E2A Melbourne bus tour!</h3>
<br>
<h5>Help plan the next Engage2Act event!</h5> 

<p><strong>Event date:</strong> 1pm-5pm, Thursday 30 July, 2015
<br><strong>Event locations:</strong> It's up to you!</br></p>

<p>Rather than choosing a standard event format we want to get out to see how communities are experiencing change and how they are being engaged in the process.</p>

<p>This ‘out of the office’ experience gives you the opportunity to either present or learn about different projects across the city. No PowerPoint, no paper, no office; just a microphone, 15 minutes of fame, bus games and a bus full of networking peers.</p>

<p>You can nominate a project on the map from <strong>3 June – 25 June</strong> by: 
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Adding a spot</strong> on the map!</li>
  <li>Voting on the projects you'd like to visit by clicking the <strong>'support'</strong> button</li>
  <li><strong>Commenting</strong> on projects</li> 
 </ul>
</p>

<p>When you have identified your priorities and we have worked out what’s possible within a four hour timeframe, we’ll ask you to book your place on the bus! In the meantime block the space out in your calendar so you don’t miss the fun.</p>
