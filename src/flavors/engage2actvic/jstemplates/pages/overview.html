<h3>Welcome to the Engage2Act bus tour!</h3>
<br>
<h5>Help plan the next Engage2Act event!</h5> 

<p><strong>Event date:</strong> 1pm-5pm, Thursday 30 July, 2015
<br><strong>Event locations:</strong> It's up to you!</br></p>

<p>We're creating an ‘out of the office’ experience that gives you the opportunity to either present or learn about different projects across Melbourne.</p>

<p>Nominate past or current projects that have assisted the community in experiencing change through engagement practices. This can be a project you've worked on or one you want to hear more about.</p>

<p>There are three ways to nominate a project on the map: 
 <ol>
  <li><strong>Nominate a new project!</strong> Click the <strong>Add a Spot</strong> button on the map, choose location and complete the survey.</li>
  <li><strong>Vote</strong> on projects already on the map by clicking the <strong>'support'</strong> button.</li>
  <li><strong>Comment</strong> on projects already on the map.</li> 
 </ol>
</p>

<p>Get your nominations in before 25 June and block the space out in your calendar so you don’t miss the fun. Check out the <a href="http://engage2actvic.crowdspot.com.au/page/why"> FAQs </a> page for more info.</p>
