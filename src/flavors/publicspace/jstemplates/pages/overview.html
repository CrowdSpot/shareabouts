<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>The City of Port Phillip needs your help to develop our public space network!</p>

<p>Public space is all around us - it is the glue connecting people to the places they work in, play in and live. The City of Port Phillip is developing a Public Space Strategy to guide the development and management of our public space network over the next 15 years.  We want your help to find out where the network works well, where it can be improved and what you think we should be doing to ensure we continue to provide quality spaces into the future.</p>

The Crowdspot tool enables you to spatially map: 
 <ul>
  <li>the places you think work well</li> 
  <li>the places you think could be improved </li>
  <li>the places you visit and what you do there</li>
  <li> your great ideas for the future of the public space network</li>
 </ul>
 
<p> Thanks for your help! </p>
