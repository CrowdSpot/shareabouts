<h1><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h1>
<h5><strong>1. How long is the map open for?</strong></p>
<p>The map is open from the 23rd of October until the 30th of October.</p>
<strong>2. What happens to the information that is collected?</strong></p>
<p>Once the majority of the data has been collected it will be migrated to an open Google Map that will be managed by Darren Sharp. If you have any queries about this can contact him at darren@shareable.net. </p>
<p><strong>3. What if I make a mistake or want to change some details?</strong></p>
<p>If you need to change something, email Anthony (anthony@crowdspot.com.au) and he'll help sort it out.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why are you using CrowdSpot and not Google Maps</strong></p>
<p>CrowdSpot is a new platform that is trying to make collaborative mapping exercises easier for everyone. The Sharing Cities Map Jam provides a great opportunity to test out a new way of collaboration that we're hoping will make the mapping exercise more exciting. As mentioned above, the data will be shifted over to Google Maps at a later date.</p>
