<h1><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h1>
<h5><strong>1. How long is the map open for?</strong></p>
<p>The map is open from the 23rd of October until the 30th of October.</p>
<strong>2. What happens to the information that is collected?</strong></p>
<p>This phase is concerned with the identification of information, not necessarily the collection. Much of the information identified will be collected at a later stage of the project. This is to ensure information is current when needed and also to confirm with the information owner that conditions of use havenâ€™t changed at the time the information is required.</p>
<p><strong>3. What if I make a mistake or want to change some details?</strong></p>
<p>If you need to change something, email Anthony (anthony@crowdspot.com.au) and he'll help sort it out.</p>
