<h1><strong>Hello!</strong><h1> 
  <h4><p>Welcome to the Melbourne Sharing Cities Map Jam hosted by Shareable. This CrowdSpot map is used to collaboratively map all the sharing goodness in Melbourne like coworking, public parks, lending libraries, carsharing, bikesharing and more.</p>
   
  <p>Mapping all of the sharing services in our city not only shows that another world is possible - it shows itâ€™s already here. Not to mention that asset maps are powerful organising tools. They make community assets more visible - which creates a foundation for further community development. Higher awareness of shared assets can lead to more collaborations between sharing projects and new project ideas to fill in the gaps.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for contributing.</p></h4>
