<h1><strong><p>Welcome!</p></strong></h1>  
<h4><p>Bayside City Council are developing a Pedestrian Strategy to support the community to make more shopping, recreational, education and social trips by walking.</p>
<p>The CrowdSpot website enables the community to spatially map where pedestrian improvement measures are required using their local knowledge and experience of Bayside.</p>
<p>You can add spots directly onto the map where you face barriers and please also vote on other spots by clicking the 'support this' button. Issues that you may wish to identify could include:</p>
<p>- Limited or no crossing facilities;</p>
<p>- Limited time to cross at traffic signals;</p>
<p>- Footpath maintenance issues;</p>
<p>- Limited or no wayfinding signage; or</p>
<p>- More seating along walking routes.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about the project please emailÂ hello@mutfung.com.</p></h4>
