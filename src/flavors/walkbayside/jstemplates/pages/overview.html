<h1><strong><p>Welcome!</p></strong></h1>  
<h4><p>Bayside City Council are developing a Pedestrian Strategy to support the community to make more shopping, recreational, education and social trips by walking.</p>
<p>This CrowdSpot website enables the community to spatially map barriers they experience or know of in Bayside.</p>
<p>You can add spots directly onto the map where you face barriers and please also vote to other spots by clicking the 'support this' button.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about the project please emailÂ hello@mutfung.com.</p></h4>
