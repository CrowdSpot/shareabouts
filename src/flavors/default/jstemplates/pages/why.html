<h1>Why CrowdSpot?</h1>

<p>Public participation in projects is an increasingly important part of the planning process. Traditional public engagement can be time consuming, costly and only appeal to a narrow demographic of the community.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visual and intuitive interface generates greater participation
  <li>Integrates seamlessly with existing websites
  <li>Responsive design allows for greater access across all browsers and devices
  <li>Complements face-to-face community engagement activities
  <li>Each project results in a collectively generated dataset
  <li>Visualise results spatially
</ul>
