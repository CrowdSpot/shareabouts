<p>
Thank you for sharing your concerns about traffic safety on Albemarle Road. Council Member Brad Lander has requested that the NYC Department of Transportation conduct a traffic safety study on the street and recommend improvements. While the agency undertakes that study, please share your concerns using this interactive map, which we will send to the Department of Transportation.
