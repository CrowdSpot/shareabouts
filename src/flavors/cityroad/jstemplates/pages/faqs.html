<p><strong>1. How can I get involved in the City Road Master Plan?</strong></p>
<p>The City of Melbourne will be conducting community engagement from Monday 17 February 2014 to Sunday 16 March 2014. During this period you will be able to share your experience of City Road via the City Road Participate Melbourne engagement portal by placing a comment on the interactive map.

<p><strong>2. What is the City Road Master Plan?</strong></p>
<p>The City of Melbourne is leading the development of a draft City Road Master Plan that aims to better balance the road’s two key roles as both an important transport link and a people friendly place. This project is a key action from the Southbank Structure Plan (2010) and responds to the changing role of this road as Southbank grows. 
<br>
<br>
The focus of the master plan will be on delivering public realm improvements within the road space and footpaths. It will explore options to change the layout and design of the road to address issues such as pedestrian safety, cycling access, transport movement & access, street character and quality, tree planting, water management and public transport provision. 
<br>
<br> 
Changes to planning controls that affect private land use and development are not within the scope of this project.
</p>
<p><strong>3. What are the boundaries of the City Road Master Plan? </strong></p>
<p>The City Road Master Plan will explore the length of City Road within the City of Melbourne, from the Westgate Freeway in the west to St Kilda Road in the east. It will also include Alexandra Avenue to the intersection with Linlithgow Avenue. In total, the length of the road is approximately two kilometres. </p>
<p><strong>4. How do I provide comments on the map? </strong></p>
<p>The map allows you to place a 'spot' on a specific location and will prompt you to share your experience and answer a few simple questions. Your comments will be visible for others to see, share and comment on, however your personal information will remain confidential. You can place as many spots as you like. 
<br>
<br>
Please be mindful that your spot will appear immediately and all spots are subject to moderation from time to time to check for relevance (spots may be edited or omitted). 
<br>
<br>
If you need to change something, email Anthony (anthony@crowdspot.com.au) and he will help sort it out.     
</p>
<p><strong>5. How will my comments be used?</strong></p>
<p>This map and all the information contributed by the public will start a conversation about the issues and potential opportunities for City Road. Views and information captured through this first stage of engagement will be used to inform the development of a draft City Road Master Plan. </p>
<p><strong>6. Who is the responsible authority for City Road? </strong></p>
<p>The City of Melbourne and VicRoads share responsibility for City Road’s management and we are investigating ways that the available road and footpath space can be best used to meet the needs of its various users. VicRoads is the responsible authority for the road carriageway from kerb to kerb. The City of Melbourne is responsible for the space from kerb line to property boundary.</p>
