<strong><h4><p>Welcome!</p></strong>  
<p>The City of Melbourne is working on a draft master plan for City Road to look at ways the road space can be improved: think pedestrian safety, cycling access, transport movement and street qualities like trees and lighting.</p>
<strong><p>The first phase of community engagement, including this interactive map, is now closed.</strong> From mid-February until mid-March 2014, many people joined in the conversation and shared their current experiences of City Road, both in person at the Boyd Community Hub and via this interactive map. These valuable comments and discussions will help inform the development of the draft master plan.</p>
<p>The second phase of community engagement will take place later in the year when the draft City Road Master Plan will be released for formal community engagement.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest and participation.</p>
