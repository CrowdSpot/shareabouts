<strong><h4><p>Welcome!</p></strong>  
<p>We think City Road can be better for everyone.</p> 
<p>The City of Melbourne is working on a draft master plan for City Road to look at ways the road space can be improved: think pedestrian safety, cycling access, transport movement and street qualities like trees and lighting.</p> 
<p>This map starts a conversation about how you experience City Road. Your response will help inform the development of the draft master plan.</p>
<p>Add a spot to the map to share your experience of City Road.</p>
<p>Thanks for getting involved.</p>
