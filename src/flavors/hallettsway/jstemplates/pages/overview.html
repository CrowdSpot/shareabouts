<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p><h5><strong>How can we further improve Halletts Way? </strong></h5></p>

<p>VicRoads will be building new freeway ramps to and from Melbourne, as well as a new bridge over the Western Freeway for pedestrians and cyclists.</p> 

<p>We want to make sure that we have considered all your thoughts as we improve access and safety for Bacchus Marsh road users. This online mapping tool gives you the opportunity to:

 <ul>
  <li>Add Spots where there are walking, bicycle and car travel issues.</li>
  <li>Rate safety along Halletts Way.</li>
  <li>Share your ideas for how we can improve Halletts Way.</li> 
 </ul>

<p>Try 'Adding a Spot'</strong></a> to the map! You can also comment on other people's spots or add your vote to a spot by clicking the <strong>'Support'</strong> button.</p>
