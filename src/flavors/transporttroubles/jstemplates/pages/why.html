<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p><strong>1. What are the different spot types and colours?</strong></p>

<p>Blue lines and spots are trains. Orange lines and spots are buses. Green lines and spots are trams. Yellow spots are ‘like spots’ to indicate where something worked well.</p>

<p><strong>2. What if I make a mistake or want to change something?</strong></p>

<p>If you need to change something, email <a href="mailto:transporttroubles@vic.greens.org.au">transporttroubles@vic.greens.org.au</a> for assistance. </p>

<p><strong>3. Do you delete any contributions?</strong></p>
<p>All spots are subject to moderation from time to time to check for inappropriate content (spots may be edited or omitted). To keep things usable, older data may be removed from the system as more transport troubles are lodged.</p>

<p><strong>4. What happens to the data collected?</strong></p>
<p>All the information collected will be used to help the Victorian Greens better understand community views about their experiences on public transport – what’s working, and what needs to be improved. The data is helpful in mapping out Greens policies for public transport investment and improvements. Using this data, we’ll lobby Daniel Andrews and the Labor Government to fix what you’ve said is broken.</p>
